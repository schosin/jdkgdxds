Thanks to Nathan Sweet, https://github.com/NathanSweet ,
for writing the original libGDX data structures, and
adding various API improvements to the data structures
used here when they were part of libGDX. Nathan wrote a
lot of the API structure and has been very influential.

Thanks to pyb1993, https://github.com/pyb1993 , for
coming up with the idea and most of the implementation
for several useful optimizations applied in version 0.2.0.

Thanks to Jon Renner, https://github.com/jrenner , for
the Select and QuickSelect code, as added to libGDX.
Jon would be a contributor but I don't have a CLA to sign.

Thanks to Sebastiano Vigna, https://github.com/vigna , for
fastutil with its useful sorts and primitive comparators.
