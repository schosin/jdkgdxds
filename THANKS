Thanks to Nathan Sweet, https://github.com/NathanSweet ,
for writing the original libGDX data structures, and
adding various API improvements to the data structures
used here when they were part of libGDX. Nathan wrote a
lot of the API structure and has been very influential.
Nathan should be a contributor here, but I don't have a
CLA to sign, and after he made me sign the CLA for
libGDX, I don't feel like putting him through the same
hassle. Do unto others, etc.

Thanks to pyb1993, https://github.com/pyb1993 , for
coming up with the idea and most of the implementation
for several useful optimizations applied in version 0.2.0.

Thanks to Jon Renner, https://github.com/jrenner , for
the Select and QuickSelect code, as added to libGDX.
Jon would be a contributor but I don't have a CLA to sign,
nor an inclination to ask him to go through that hassle.

Thanks to Sebastiano Vigna, https://github.com/vigna , for
fastutil with its useful sorts and primitive comparators.
Most of the com.github.tommyettinger.ds.support.sort
package is from fastutil.

Thanks again to Sebastiano Vigna and David Blackman, who
designed the Xoshiro256** generator, present here with
only the changes necessary for the Java port from their
CC0-licensed C code: https://prng.di.unimi.it/xoshiro256starstar.c

Thanks to CERN, for not destroying the Earth in a black
hole, and also for providing the sort code used by
ObjectComparators.

Thanks to Guy Steele and the rest of the team behind Java
8's SplittableRandom class, which is very similar in
structure and design to DistinctRandom here. Also some
thanks to Guy Steele in particular for providing only
"slow generators" in Java 17, leaving room for third
parties to provide "fast generators." We don't implement
Java 17 random number generator interfaces for a reason.

Thanks to Mark Overton for making the Romu generators freely
available; this library provides RomuTrio as an option for
an EnhancedRandom implementation. No code was directly taken
from the Romu sources at https://romu-random.org/ , but a port
by Bradley Grainger from https://github.com/bgrainger/RomuRandom
was used as a basis. Thanks also to Bradley Grainger.

Thanks to Robin Wang, who wrote a much-higher-quality SkipListMap
implementation and MIT-licensed it at https://github.com/MottoX/SkipList .
It is possible jdkgdxds will add sorted maps and sets based off of
a skip list data structure; for now, ObjectObjectSortedMap is derived
directly from Wang's SkipListMap in the test folder.
ObjectObjectSortedMapTest is also originally by Wang.

Thanks to the libGDX Discord and all of the libGDX contributors!
This applies in particular to the changes in 0.2.8, involving
the removeAll() method.

Thanks to Dmitrii Tikhomirov and Colin Alworth from the GWT Gitter,
for helping track down an incredibly strange bug that affected GWT
and was resolved in 1.1.2 . My apologies to LandoSystem from the
libGDX Discord, who published his Ludum Dare 52 entry
( https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52/reapo-man-death-who )
without using jdkgdxds because of that bug.

Thanks to Daniele Conti ( https://github.com/fourlastor ) from the
libGDX community for somehow, despite all odds against him,
figuring out how to get Gradle to supply the sources of jdkgdxds'
dependencies to GWT projects that depend on jdkgdxds. This is
something I had tried more than once and always failed, every time,
so huge thanks are in order!
