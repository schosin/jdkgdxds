/**
 * A faster and much-higher-quality substitute for {@link Random}.
 * Like how a laser is made of many beams of photons that don't cross paths, this allows many different
 * random number streams that don't overlap either.
 * <br>
 * This fills in much of the functionality of MathUtils in libGDX, though with all code as instance methods
 * instead of static methods, and some things renamed (randomTriangular() became {@link #nextTriangular()},
 * for instance, and random() became {@link #nextFloat()}). It also supplies some rare and sometimes-useful
 * code: {@link #skip(long)} allows "fast-forward" and "rewind," you can get and set the exact state with
 * {@link #getStateA()}, {@link #getStateB()}, {@link #setStateA(long)}, and {@link #setStateB(long)} (which
 * is useful if you want to save a LaserRandom and reload it later), and there's bounded int and long
 * generators which can use a negative number as their exclusive outer bound {@link #nextSignedInt(int)} and
 * {@link #nextSignedLong(long)}, plus overloads that take an inner bound).
 * <br>
 * Every method defined in this class advances the state by the same amount unless otherwise documented (only
 * {@link #nextTriangular()} and {@link #nextTriangular(float)} advance the state twice). The state can
 * advance 2 to the 64 times before the sequence of random numbers repeats, which would take a few years of
 * continuous generation. There are also 2 to the 63 possible sequences this can produce; you can tell which
 * one you're using with {@link #getStream()}. Note, {@link Random} can only advance 2 to the 48 times, which
 * takes under half a day to make it repeat on recent laptop hardware while also analyzing the numbers for
 * statistical issues. If statistical quality is a concern, don't use {@link Random}, since the aforementioned
 * analysis finds statistical failures in about a minute when checking about 16GB of output; this class can
 * produce 64TB of random output without a tool like PractRand finding any failures (sometimes it can't find
 * any minor anomaly over several days of testing).
 * <br>
 * You can copy this class independently of the library it's part of; it's meant as a general replacement for
 * Random and also RandomXS128. LaserRandom is generally faster than RandomXS128, and can be over 3x faster
 * when running on OpenJ9 (generating over 3 billion random long values per second). On top of that, this
 * doesn't have the statistical failures that the outdated XorShift128+ algorithm has.
 * <br>
 * Pew pew! Lasers!

	 * A way of taking a double in the (0.0, 1.0) range and mapping it to a Gaussian or normal distribution, so high
	 * inputs correspond to high outputs, and similarly for the low range. This is centered on 0.0 and its standard
	 * deviation seems to be 1.0 (the same as {@link java.util.Random#nextGaussian()}). If this is given an input of 0.0
	 * or less, it returns -38.5, which is slightly less than the result when given {@link Double#MIN_VALUE}. If it is
	 * given an input of 1.0 or more, it returns 38.5, which is significantly larger than the result when given the
	 * largest double less than 1.0 (this value is further from 1.0 than {@link Double#MIN_VALUE} is from 0.0). If
	 * given {@link Double#NaN}, it returns whatever {@link Math#copySign(double, double)} returns for the arguments
	 * {@code 38.5, Double.NaN}, which is implementation-dependent. It uses an algorithm by Peter John Acklam, as
	 * implemented by Sherali Karimov.

	 * <br>
	 * Acklam's algorithm and Karimov's implementation are both quite fast. This appears faster than generating
	 * Gaussian-distributed numbers using either the Box-Muller Transform or Marsaglia's Polar Method, though it isn't
	 * as precise and can't produce as extreme min and max results in the extreme cases they should appear. If given
	 * a typical uniform random {@code double} that's exclusive on 1.0, it won't produce a result higher than
	 * {@code 8.209536145151493}, and will only produce results of at least {@code -8.209536145151493} if 0.0 is
	 * excluded from the inputs (if 0.0 is an input, the result is {@code 38.5}). A chief advantage of using this with
	 * a random number generator is that it only requires one random double to obtain one Gaussian value;
	 * {@link Random#nextGaussian()} generates at least two random doubles for each two Gaussian values, but may rarely
	 * require much more random generation.
	 * <br>
	 * This can be used both as an optimization for generating Gaussian random values, and as a way of generating
	 * Gaussian values that match a pattern present in the inputs (which you could have by using a sub-random sequence
	 * as the input, such as those produced by a van der Corput, Halton, Sobol or R2 sequence). Most methods of generating
	 * Gaussian values (e.g. Box-Muller and Marsaglia polar) do not have any way to preserve a particular pattern.
	 *
	 * @param d should be between 0 and 1, exclusive, but other values are tolerated
	 * @return a normal-distributed double centered on 0.0; all results will be between -38.5 and 38.5, both inclusive
